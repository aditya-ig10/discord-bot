```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1474841479997423636&permissions=3145728&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

- ✅ Gives necessary permissions:
  - Send Messages

2. Select the server you want to add Rashi to
3. Make sure you have "Manage Server" permission
4. Click "Authorize"
5. Complete the CAPTCHA if prompted
6. Done! Rashi will appear in your server

## 🎮 After Adding:

Test Rashi with:
```
/chat message: hey
```

Or mention her:
```
@Rashi what's up
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues:

### "Missing Permissions"
- You need "Manage Server" permission in the Discord server
- Ask a server admin to add the bot

### "Bot Not Responding"
- Make sure the bot is online (check terminal: "Bot is ready to respond to messages!")
- Use `/chat` command or mention the bot

### "Application Commands Not Showing"
- Wait a few minutes for Discord to sync
- Try `/chat` manually
- Kick and re-invite the bot if needed
